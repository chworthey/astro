Copy the astronomy data to `./data` such that the structure looks like `./data/spectra/m33_0.01/cp/...`

## Start the Notebook

Boot the notebook with:
```sh
docker-compose up
```

## Playing around with the notebook...

Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in a web browser to interact with the notebook, and navigate to `workspace/AstroM33.ipynb` in the browser.
